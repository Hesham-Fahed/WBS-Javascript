## Grundlagen
- application-layer protocol https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer

- for transmitting hypermedia documents
- designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, can also be used for other purposes
- HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response
-  stateless protocol = server does not keep any data (state) between two requests
- can be used on any reliable transport layer, i.e. not UDP
